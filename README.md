# Fibonacci-Sequence
With this project I learned how to work with arrays and their positions

This program shows a textbox asking for how many numbers from the fibonacci sequence the user wants to see. After the user pressed the button and the sequence shows up on the ListView and the textbox is now used to delete a certain position from the sequence.
